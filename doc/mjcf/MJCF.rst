:mod:`ikpy.mjcf.MJCF` module
----------------------------------------

MJCF (MuJoCo XML Format) is MuJoCo's native format for defining robots and environments.
Unlike URDF which has a flat structure with separate joints and links,
MJCF uses a hierarchical structure where bodies are nested inside each other.

For more information about MJCF, see the `MuJoCo documentation <https://mujoco.readthedocs.io/en/latest/modeling.html>`_.
